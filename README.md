# Golang practice. Some task solving

[Binary Tree sums](https://github.com/lvl0nax/go_practise/tree/master/binary_tree_branch_sums)
Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and returns a list of its branch sums ordered from leftmost branch sum to rightmost branch sum.

[Two Numbers sum](https://github.com/lvl0nax/go_practise/tree/master/two_number_sum)
Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and an integer representing a target sum. If any two numbers in the input array sum up to the target sum, the function should return them in an array, in any order. If no two numbers sum up to the target sum, the function should return an empty array.

[String reverse](https://github.com/lvl0nax/go_practise/tree/master/string_reverse)
Write a function that takes a string and return reversed string

[Smallest difference](https://github.com/lvl0nax/go_practise/tree/master/smallest_difference)
Write a function that takes in two non-empty arrays of integers, finds the pair of numbers (one from each array) whose absolute difference is closest to zero, and returns an array containing these two numbers, with the number from the first array in the first position.

[Play with Channels](https://github.com/lvl0nax/go_practise/tree/master/channels)
Some random code to practise a bit with channels
