Need to write a function which takes a binary tree and returns a list of branch sums

Input:
```
tree = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

          ||
          \/

tree =     1
        /     \
       2       3
     /   \    /  \
    4     5  6    7
   / \   /
  8   9 10
```

Sample Output:
```go
[15,16,18,10,11]
```
